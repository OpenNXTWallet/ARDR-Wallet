This is an IntelliJ plugin to manage Ardor contract deployment.
Install This plugin from the IntelliJ settings plugins page.

To build the plugin:
1. Checkout the IntelliJ community edition sources https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community
2. Open the folder containing this readme file in IntelliJ as an IntelliJ project
3. Follow the instructions here to setup the SDK for the project
https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/setting_up_environment.html
4. Package a new plugin version by right clicking the ContractManagerPlugin module inside the IntelliJ project, 
then choose "Prepare plugin module '...' for deployment" a new ContractManagerPlugin.zip is created.

Note:
The plugin configuration file is located in the META-INF folder. Inside this META-INF folder there is a second
META-INF folder containing the plugin svg icon. 
This is a workaround to get IntelliJ to package this icon correctly and might change in the future.
