 * Sample contract which receives amount from the trigger transaction and returns a random amount between 0 and twice the received amount.
 * Warning:
 * This design is inappropriate for gambling applications. The reason is that users can trigger this contract using a phased
 * transaction and later not approve the trigger and response transactions in case they do not like the results.
 * For a better approach to gambling application see the AllForOnePayment sample contract.
