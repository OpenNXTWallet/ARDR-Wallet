This is a bugfix release, addressing an issue with the Standby Shuffler add-on.
The recipient public keys were incorrectly generated with an \r character
appended to the user-supplied secret phrases, resulting in actual recipient
accounts different from what was displayed in the UI.

For users of the Standby Shuffler add-on who already had their shuffling
recipient account affected by this issue, a simple RecoverFunds API has been
added. Use that API with the secretPhrase of the intended shuffling recipient
account to automatically transfer your shuffled coins to the correct recipient.

Fixed version update hash validation.
